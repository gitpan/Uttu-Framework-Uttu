An Uttu site account gives you a content area and the ability to publish
Uttu-related items.  You'll be able to share function sets, frameworks,
components, documentation, publish Uttu-powered sites, etc.

<h2>Content Area</h2>
<p>
Your content area is a virtual file system of sorts containing folders and
items. Folders can contain items and other folders.  Items come in various
types, detailed in the next section.
</p>
<p>
The root of your content area is <code>/user/<emph>user_id</emph></code>,
usually displayed as <code>/Home</code>.  Underneath the root are three
standard folders:
<ul>
  <li> <code>Stage</code>:  This is where you create and edit items.
  <li> <code>Live</code>:   This is where you publish items to.  It's the
			    only area where items can be seen by other
			    users.
  <li> <code>Trash</code>:  This is where items go when you delete them.
			    For a limited time, you can recover
			    accidentally deleted items from the trash.
</ul>
When you first enter you content area, you'll be taken automatically to you
Stage area.  You can navigate to the other areas manually, though you
cannot create or edit items there.
</p>
