                     ------------------------

Uttu::Framework::Uttu is a sample (but working) framework that sits atop
the Uttu module and provides a reasonable environment for building web
applications.

To install Uttu, download the distribution, untar, and cd into the
resulting directory.  There, run the following:

  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test (optional)
  % make install


You will also need to create a MySQL (or equivalent) database with the
following table:

  CREATE TABLE functions (
    file char(255) not null,
    uri  char(255) not null
  );
  ALTER TABLE functions ADD INDEX(file);
  ALTER TABLE functions ADD INDEX(uri);


Changing the table name and the field names is acceptable if you specify
the SQL in the configuration file (see the Uttu perldoc for more
information).

No non-trivial tests are provided at the moment.  Eventually, the
Apache::Test framework will be used to test the module.

The author lurks on both the HTML::Mason list and the mod_perl list.  Feel
free to send questions there.
